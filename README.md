# Speedtalk Agreement 

![Speedtalk](/img/speed.jpg)

In order to speed up our communication, I propose the following conventions:

+ [Specify all parameters in a single request](#specify-all-parameters-in-a-single-request)
+ [Drop courtesy modifiers](#drop-courtesy-modifiers)
+ [Drop probability modifiers](#drop-probability-modifiers)
+ [Use direct approvals & rejections](#use-direct-approvals---rejections)
+ [Use abbreviations](#use-abbreviations)
+ [Use "+" to accept a proposal](#use--to-accept-a-proposal)
+ [Use "$url - ?" to request feedback](#use-url----to-request-feedback)
+ [Use "++" to mark the task as completed](#use--to-mark-the-task-as-completed)

## Rationale

People communicate slowly because of fear:

* Fear of being rejected after saying explicitly what you want.
* Fear of being misunderstood after sending a short message.

Speedtalk allows people to drop the fears by mutually accepting this Agreement.

## Good faith

I'm proposing this agreement in good faith. I hereby assure you that:

* I want to talk with you.
* I want to work with you.
* I want to walk with you.

This agreement only covers business & is not (necessarily) applicable to friendship or romance.

## Conventions

### Specify all parameters in a single request
  * Fast:
    * *Meeting today at 16:00 at Golden Fish restaurant: $url?*
    * *OK*
  * Slow:
    * *Would you like to meet today?*
    * *Yes, what time?*
    * *How about 16:00?*
    * *Sounds good, where?*
    * *How about a restaurant in downtown?*
    * *OK, which one?*
    * *Golden Fish*
    * *Where is it located?*
    * *Farham street*
    * *Could you please send the location?*
    * *$url*
    * *OK, see you there*
    
### Drop courtesy modifiers

Examples: "Could you please", "Would you like to", ...

  * Fast:
    * *$url - ?*
    * *+*
  * Slow:
    * *Could you please provide feedback on my project: $url?*
    * *Of course, please check your email*

### Drop probability modifiers

Examples: "I think", "Most probably", ...

  * Fast:
    * *We can meet today*
    * *+*
  * Slow:
    * *I think we can meet today*
    * *+*

The probability modifiers should be left in place if they are required by context (*"I will buy an umbrella because it'll probably rain tomorrow"*).

### Use direct approvals & rejections
  * Fast:
    * *I want to give a discount to our prospects*
    * *-, will hurt revenue* 
  * Slow:
    * *I want to give a discount to our prospects*
    * *I'm afraid I have to reject your idea, because it would have a negative impact on our revenue numbers*

### Use abbreviations
  * "[Focused](./en/focused.md)" - I'm currently focused on a task, will reply after finishing it. If it's urgent, please call immediately.

### Use "+" to accept a proposal
  * Fast:
    * *I want to give a discount to our prospects*
    * *+*
  * Slow:
    * *I want to give a discount to our prospects*
    * *Feel free to do it*

### Use "$url - ?" to request feedback
  * Fast:
    * *$url - ?*
    * *+*
  * Slow:
    * *Feedback on $url?*
    * *Done, please check your email*

### Use "++" to mark the task as completed
  * Fast:
    * *Review new design*
    * *++*
  * Slow:
    * *Could you please send me provide your opinion on the design that I've been working on?*
    * *Sure - I've just shared my thoughts via email, please check your inbox*
