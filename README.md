# Speedtalk Agreement 

In order to speed up our communication, I propose the following conventions:

* Specify all parameters in a single request:
  * Fast:
    * *Meeting today at 16:00 at Golden Fish restaurant: $url?*
    * *OK*
  * Slow:
    * *Would you like to meet today?*
    * *Yes, what time?*
    * *How about 16:00?*
    * *Sounds good, where?*
    * *How about a restaurant in downtown?*
    * *OK, which one?*
    * *Golden Fish*
    * *Where is it located?*
    * *Farham street*
    * *Could you please send the location?*
    * *$url*
    * *OK, see you there*
* Use "+" or "OK" to indicate acknowledgement / agreement / confirmation:
  * Fast:
    * *I want to propose a discount to our prospects*
    * *+*
  * Slow:
    * *I want to propose a discount to our prospects*
    * *Feel free to do it*
* Use "+" to indicate completion of the task:
  * Fast:
    * *Design review to email?*
    * *+*
  * Slow:
    * *Could you please send me an email with the design review that you've been working on?*
    * *Sure - I've just sent it, please check your inbox*
* Drop courtesy modifiers ("Could you please", "Would you like to", ...):
  * Fast:
    * *Feedback on $url?*
    * *+*
  * Slow:
    * *Could you please provide feedback on my project: $url?*
    * *Of course*
* Drop probability modifiers ("I think", "Most probably", ...), unless required by context:
  * Fast:
    * *We can meet today*
    * *+*
  * Slow:
    * *I think we can meet today*
    * *+*
* Use direct forms instead of indirect ones:
  * Fast:
    * *I want to propose a discount to our prospects*
    * *-, will hurt revenue* 
  * Slow:
    * *I would like to propose a discount to our prospects*
    * *I'm afraid I have to reject your idea, because it would have a negative impact on our revenue numbers*
* Use the following short messages to convey extra meaning:
  * "[Focused](./en/focused.md)" - I'm currently focused on a task, will reply after finishing it. If it's urgent, please call immediately.

## Rationale

People communicate slowly because of fear:

* Fear of being rejected after saying explicitly what you want.
* Fear of being misunderstood after sending a short message.

Speedtalk shortens messages by assuming that speakers don't have those fears, because they've explicitly accepted the Speedtalk Agreement.

## Good faith

I'm proposing this agreement in good faith. I hereby assure you that:

* I want to talk with you.
* I want to work with you.
* I want to walk with you.

This agreement only covers business communication & is not applicable to friendship, romance or leisure.
